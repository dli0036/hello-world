Hello, my name is Diana and I am a fourth year computer science major at Brooklyn college.
Currently I'm taking the class 3140 and look forward to seeing what I can learn this semester.
I enjoy cooking and hiking, scenic spots, and scifi movies/tv. Last tv show I watched was Westworld, a tv series about 
AI and robots living amongst humans in a segregated world set in a Western cowboy style themepark.
